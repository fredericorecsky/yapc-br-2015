            <h1> Hello Volunteers!! </h1>

            <p>
                Actually we are organizing the yapc in Taubate and
                we need help for some tasks. Feel free to contact us
                at cartas at frederico me

            <h2> Online Help </h2>

            <p>
                Since we are now few, we are using a bunch of static
                pages to serve the event. Our priority is close any
                thing/problem related with the hotel and conference
                place, so I'm not working hard on the website.
            </p>

            <h3> What we need </h3>

            <p>
                The source code of this pages are on github, so feel
                free to clone it and send patches, don't need to ask
                just do it and it will be fine.
            </p>
